    "Our group's goal was to make an image editing app and painting app, and then connect the service to a login system / user database that would allow them to share their artwork. The front end is based in HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and the backend is based in Python through Flask. The authentication between the two is done by JWT, or Json Web Tokens.\n",

    "Our team as a whole worked on the front end to develop the features of the website, and one of my more experienced teammates would provide helpful advice that would help us develop better as developers. I worked on the main website frontend and styling as well as making the posting feature, where users can post photos live on the website. \n"
