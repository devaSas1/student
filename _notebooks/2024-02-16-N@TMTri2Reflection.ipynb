    "- We could fix up the frontend to be a lot more modern\n",
    "- We could've been more interactive with more people. We could've called more people over to us to present our project.\n",

    "I saw a CSP project which was a website where it can help people buy real estate. I was very impressed by frontend and how clean it was. It used an AI algorithm to help people buy real estate and I can easily see how this could be used in the future. It was a well executed project in all its features (e.g. inputting users, display users, sorting users, etc.)\n",

    "Outside of Compsci, I saw a very beautiful painting of an old man in East Asian Attire with a Conical Hat who is fishing. It's very serene and ethereal and I really love the aesthetic.\n",
