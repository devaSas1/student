## About Me
I'm 15 years old, I play guitar, I love cars, coffee, business, and occasionally I make youtube videos about fitness and such. I haven't enjoyed programming in the past, and I hope that changes with this experience of coding my own blog

## My favorite things 
**I love cars. If you like cars too, come to me and we can talk for hours**

**Coffee is good too. It keeps me from outright failing my classes**
